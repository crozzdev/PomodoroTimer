# Pomodoro Timer or 25 + 5 Clock Project

The project contains two folders:

- `vanillaApp/` : Which contains the project developed using only vanilla JavaScript.
- `reactApp/` : The same project but developed using React 18 and vanilla CSS.

Both projects have successfully passed the tests which are available in this [codePen](https://codepen.io/pen?template=MJjpwO) Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js

## Important notes

- The vanilla version was built only for practicing purposes, you should review the React version if you want to see, well, React in action. Although both versions pass the tests, you should review and submit the React version which is the main idea of the fCC frontEnd libraries certification.
- All contributions are welcomed by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.

A big thanks to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for giving me the needed lessons for this project!
